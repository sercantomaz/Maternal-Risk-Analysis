# Maternal Health Risk Analysis
## Purpose of the Project <br>
This repository contains the implementation of maternal health risk analysis using various machine learning algorithms in the R programming language. The goal of this project is to accurately predict maternal health outcomes based on a variety of medical factors.

## Machine Learning Models Used <br>
The following machine learning models were utilized for the classification task:
* Random Forest
* Classification Tree
  
## Contents of the Repository
### R Scripts:
* Scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation.

### Dataset:
* The maternal health dataset used for training and evaluating the models.

### Results:
* A PDF document containing the performance metrics of each model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score etc.
